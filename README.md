# translator-page-of-html
hey there, in this repository I'm translating a HTML page using google's API
we have a dropdown powered by google to translate the whole page into the selected language 
the src in the script tag is basically having the link of google translate and after 'cb' we have googleTranslateinit which is basically connecting it with the html part where we have written the body which can be translated .
